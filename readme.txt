== Description ==

Hi, we're a collection of archive functions for WordPress. Use us to display archives of your content in "Timeline" or "Sitemap" format, using either a shortcode, action or template tag.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Upload the plugin zip file using the Upload function in the WordPress backend in the 'Plugins' menu area
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Place either [woothemes_archives_timeline] or [woothemes_archives_sitemap] in the content area of a page to display the timeline or sitemap functionality on the frontend.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What about existing functionality in my WooTheme? =

Yes your existing theme will still work, but we recommend using the plugin for displaying your Sitemap and Timeline going forward, as these are the officially supported functionality plugins.

= How do I use this in my template files? =

To display the Timeline use this snippet:
`<?php echo do_shortcode('[woothemes_archives_timeline]'); ?>`
To display the Sitemap use this snippet:
`<?php echo do_shortcode('[woothemes_archives_sitemap]'); ?>`
